# week7_project
Technical Requirements
For this project, you’ll have to recreate a pre-existing design using your HTML & CSS skills. You’ll also have to create a few interactions with the DOM, using what you’ve learned about JavaScript so far.

Finally, you’ll have to deploy this project to Netlify, using the Git CLI to do so. When you’re finished, you’ll have your first website live and ready for anyone to interact with it!

At a minimum, you should meet the following technical requirements:

Your website should be rendered in a browser
Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
Have a repo on GitHub
Have at least 1 commit per day that you worked on it
Be deployed online using Netlify so that anybody can access it
Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principles
Replicate the pages where the design files have been supplied using HTML and CSS
Ensure your website is responsive
Implement any functionality on your website using JavaScript
Create a README file that covers all of the application’s features, configuration and specifications
BONUS: For extra credits, add some additional functionality to your website beyond the scope of this brief. e.g. a working 404 page
Tips for success :rocket:
Be careful not to duplicate your code in any other language. E.g. if you create functionality in JavaScript, don’t duplicate this in HTML/CSS
Write clean, modular and efficient code following best practices
Name your folders and files clearly and consistently
Apply indentation conventions to your sources code and name your functions and variables logically
Remove any unused code from your source code
Use separate git branches for development and deployment

Deliverables
The URL of the GitHub repository for your project
The URL of the live website on the Internet
The URL of the slides for your project presentation
You must present your project during the Project 1 presentations

Project assets
For this project, you’ll have access to the following assets:

A Figma design that you will have to turn into a live, responsive website. This design also includes a few specifications regarding fonts and colors
A folder with all the images you will need for this project.
